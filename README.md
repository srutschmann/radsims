Simulation study on the performance of species tree estimation

This repository contains all the scripts used for the simulation of RAD-seq data, species tree estimation, and post-analyses.

## RAD-seq simulation
1) Species and locus tree simulation
2) Sequence simulation and allelic dropout

## Species tree estimation
1) Concatenation-based maximum likelihood inference
2) Coalescent-based species tree estimation
3) Coalescent-based summary species tree estimation

## Post-analyses
1) Comparison of tree topologies
